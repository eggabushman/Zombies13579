				<h3>Shamblers</h3>
				<p>These are your standard, textbook zombies. They are slow, but persistent. Unlike Runners which are more solitary, Shamblers have a tendency to form Hordes.</p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: 5</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h3>Runners</h3>
				<p>These zombies are the most dangerous. Upon spotting a meal, they sprint towards it as fast as their rotting legs can go. As they donâ€™t get short of breath, they can pursue for a very long time. </p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: 8</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h3>Crawlers</h3>
				<p>These zombies are characterized by their inability to walk on two legs, due to lower body decay or complete limb severance.They are low to the ground and are more stealthy than other types of zombies. Watch your feet, else you may be tripped or even bitten!</p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: 4</b></p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h3>Hordes</h3>
				<p>Formed by large clusters of Shamblers, Hordes possess a hivemind that will direct the undead mob towards any sight, smell, or sound of human activity. Hordes have been spotted as large as 10,000 zombies, and tend to appear during changing seasons in a behavior similar to migratory birds.</p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: 10</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h3>Zombie Dogs</h3>
				<p>Man's worst friend. Zombified dogs are incredibly fast and have increased senses.Their bark can quickly draw more of the undead to your location.</p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: 9</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-4">
				<h3>Zombie Cats</h3>
				<p>A stealthy counterpart to their canine enemies, Zombie Cats are just as deadly with their climbing abilities and their acute vision that allows them to see perfectly in the dark.</p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: 6</b></p>

				<h3>Mysterious Wanderers</h3>
				<p>If ever someone who is alone asks for shelter or a space among your group, ask yourself: If this person is truly alone, what acts have they committed to survive such an unforgiving environment for so long? Never let anyone inside your base without first subduing them and then interrogating them to discover their truthful origins. Sympathy should unfortunately be last among your list of priorities. Outsiders will not hesistate to ruin what safety you have accomplished, so err on the side of caution and DO NOT BE A VICTIM.</p>
				<p><b>Threat Level: Varying</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-5">
				<h3>Bandits/Raiders</h3>
				<p>To survive, some individuals take extreme measures of violence and malintent. Bandits and/or Raiders are such individuals who have made a career on killing and robbing their fellow human survivors. Deranged or not, take great caution when engaging larger groups that are well-armed and far more militant in appearance.</p>

				<h3>Weather (or Forces of Nature)</h3>
				<p>Refrain from venturing outside in heavy rain or even light snow. Rain/Snow will most often put YOU at a disadvantage, since the zombies will be impervious to the external stimuli and your vision will be hampered. Be just as concerned about extreme heat or cold, as these elements can be just as deadly when conditions are strained.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-5">
				<h3>Sickness (or Health & Hygiene Risks)</h3>
				<p>If someone is suffering from the flu or any other contagious sickness, immediately isolate the individual from all members of your party, especially the weaker or more vulnerable ones. Someone infected by a zombie bite should also be isolated and restrained so that they do not potentially harm those guarding them. Cleaniness and hygiene should be enforced as strictly as an communal measure or social law, because oftentimes a group's survival could depend on it.</p>
